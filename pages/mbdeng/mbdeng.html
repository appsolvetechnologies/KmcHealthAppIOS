            <li>Visit a KMC-run Ward Health Unit soon after you catch sudden fever and avail free facilities for blood test for malaria/dengue and platelet count.</li>

            <li>For detection of dengue NS1 antigen and dengue IgM antibody, get your blood tests done by ELISA, not by any Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit.</li>
            <li>In case symptoms like sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, joint pain, rash, bleeding from nose, gum or with stool develop, consult a physician immediately.</li>
            <li>If you catch dengue/malaria, please send the report to the KMC-run health centre located in your ward.</li>
            <li>Use mosquito repellents liberally to prevent mosquito-bites at daytime.</li> 
            <li>Empty and clean water storage containers properly at a weekly interval. </li>
            <li>Donâ€™t stack unused tyres, plastics, coconut shells, industrial scraps, domestic wastes and other such discarded items in the open space.</li>
